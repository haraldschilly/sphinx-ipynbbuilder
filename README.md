# Builder for Sphinx producing Jupyter Notebook files

## TODO

1. register a builder named `ipynb` (how properly?) -- code is currently doing something
1. add itself as an extension (since version 1.6 this should be "easy": http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/extdev/index.html#discovery-of-builders-by-entry-point ???)
1. `make ipynb` should produce a lot of `.ipynb` files in the `build` subdirectory -- success!
